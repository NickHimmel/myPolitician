## Summary
  myPolitician is an interactive map that is used to find a user's representative
  at all levels of the government. From the state to the local level, users will
  also be able to see upcoming policies that will be voted on by their representative
  as well as how they have voted on past policies.

  The goal of myPolitician is to provide users with a tool that empowers them with
  information on how their representatives are voting on their behalf. With this
  information, users can then make informed decisions on who they want to represent
  them.
